In the case of Animal Welfare Board of India -vs- A. \nNagaraja and Others [(2014) 7 SCC 547], a Division Bench of this \nCourt had essentially outlawed two common sports practised in the \nStates of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra popularly referred to as \n\u2018Jallikattu\u2019 and \u2018Bullock  Cart Race\u2019 respectively.  These bovine \nsports were held to be contrary to the provisions of Sections 3, \n11(1)(a) and (m) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 \n(\u201c1960 Act\u201d) which is a Statute enacted by the Parliament. The two \nJudge Bench h ad construed the said provisions in the \nConstitutional backdrop of Article 51-A (g) and (h) as also Articles \n14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. This judgment was delivered \non 7th May 2014. At that point of time, Jallikattu was regulated by \na State Act  in Tamil Nadu, being Tamil Nadu Regulation of \nJallikattu Act, 2009. The Bench held that this State Act was \nrepugnant to the provisions of the 1960 Act and was held to be \nvoid, having regard to the provisions of Article 254 (1) of the \nConstitution of India .  On 7 th January 2016, a notification was \nissued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change \n(\u201cMoEF&CC\u201d) [bearing number GSR 13 (E)].  This notification was \n3 \n \nissued in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 22 of the 1960 \nAct and prohibited exhibition or training of bulls as performing \nanimals. However, an exception was carved and it was specified in \nthis notification that bulls might be continued to be trained as \nperforming animals at events such as Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu and \nBullock Cart Races in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, Haryana, \nKerala and Gujarat in the manner by the customs of common \ncommunity or practice traditionally under the customs or as part \nof culture in any part of the country.  In the State of Karnataka, \nthe race involved male buffaloes, known in that State as \u201cKambala\u201d. \nThis exception, however, was made subject to certain conditions \nseeking to reduce the pain and suffering of bulls while being used \nin such sports. A batch of writ petitions i.e. W.P. (C) Nos. 2 3 of \n2016, 24 of 2016, 25 of 2016, 26 of 2016, 27 of 2016, 88 of 2016, \n1059 of 2017, 1011 of 2017, 1188 of 2017, 1193 of 2017, SLP(C) \nNo.3528 of 2018 and SLP(C) Nos. 3526 -3527 of 2018 were \ninstituted before a Division Bench of this Court questioning legality \nof the said notification. The petitioners in those proceedings also \nsought compliance with the directions of this Court contained in \nthe case of A. Nagaraja (supra). \n3. The first of these writ petitions have been brought by Animal \nWelfare Board of India  and others including one Anjali Sharma, \n4 \n \nbut in course of hearing, the Animal Welfare Board changed its \nstance and sought to support the stand of the State and Union of \nIndia mainly on the ground that the 1960 Act and certain State \nAmendments which were en acted in the year 2017 were not \nrepugnant and the Board had framed guidelines to prevent \nsuffering of the bovine species during holding of the aforesaid \nevents. We shall refer to the three State Amendment Acts later in \nthis judgment. However, the second writ petitioner- Anjali Sharma, \na practicing advocate of this Court and also a member of the Board \nprosecuted the aforesaid writ petition as a single writ petitioner.  \n4. In connection with W.P.(C) No.1188 of 2017, an Interlocutory \nApplication (170346 of 2022) has been filed by one Vikramsinh \nNivrutti Bhosale on the strength of his being an agriculturalist in \nMaharashtra. He has argued that the challenge to the Maharashtra \nAmendment Act, if sustained, could hampe r lives of farmers still \nassociated with Bullock Cart Race.  It is also his argument that the \nAmendment Act of Maharashtra is also relatable to entry 15 of List \nII of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India which \nstipulates:- \n\u201cPreservation, protection and improvement of stock and prevention \nof animal diseases; veterinary training and practice\u201d. \n \n5 \n \n5. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu \nAmendment) Act, 2017, (\u201cTamil Nadu Amendment Act\u201d),  The \nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, \n2017 (\u201cMaharashtra Amendment Act\u201d) and The Prevention of \nCruelty to Animals (Karnataka Second Amendment) Act, 2017 \n(\u201cKarnataka Amendment Act\u201d) were enacted by the respective State \nLegislatures and had received Presidential asse nt.  We shall refer \nto these Acts in greater details in this judgment. These Amendment \nActs in substance seek to legitimise various types of bovine sports \nincluding Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, Bullock Cart Race in \nMaharashtra and Kambala in Karnataka.  The t erm Jallikattu as \ndefined in the Tamil Nadu Amendment Act is as follows:- \n\u201c(dd) \u201cJallikattu\u201d means an event involving bulls conducted \nwith a view to follow tradition and culture on such days \nfrom the months of January to May of a calendar year and \nin such places, as may be notified by the State Government, \nand includes \u201cmanjuviratu\u201d, \u201cvadamadu\u201d and \n\u201cerudhuvidumvizha\u201d.\u201d \n \nIn the Karnataka Amendment Act, the term Kambala has \nbeen defined, upon Amendment of the parent Statute as:- \n\u201c(aa) \u201cBulls race or Bullock c art race\u201d means any form \nof bulls race including race of Bullock cart as a traditional \nsports involving Bulls whether tied to cart with the help of \nwooden yoke or not (in whatever name called) normally held \nas a part of tradition and culture in the state o n such days \nand places, as may be notified by the State Government.\u201d; \nand  \n(ii) after clause (d), the following shall be inserted, namely:- \n6 \n \n(dd) \u201cKambala\u201d means the traditional sports event \ninvolving Buffalo\u2019s (male) race normally held as a part of \ntradition and culture in the state on such days and places, \nas may be notified by the State Government.\u201d \n \nBullock Cart Race as held in Maharashtra has been defined under \nSection 2 of the Amendment Act as:- \n\u201c(bb) \u201cbullock cart race\u201d means an event involving bulls or \nbullocks to conduct a race, whether tied to cart with the help \nof wooden yoke or not (by whatever name called), with or \nwithout a cartman with a view to follow tradition and \nculture on such days and in any District where it is being \ntraditionally held a t such places, as may be previously \napproved by the District Collector, and also known as \n\u201cBailgada Sharyat\u201d, \u201cChhakadi\u201d and \u201cShankarpat\u201d in the \nState of Maharashtra.\u201d \n \n6. A Public Interest Litigation (\u201cPIL\u201d) was brought before the \nHigh Court of Judicature at Bombay, registered as PIL (stamp) \nnumber 23132 of 2017 ( Ajay Marathe vs. The State of \nMaharashtra and Others ) challenging certain proposed Rules \nbrought by the State of Maharashtra under the heading \u201cThe \nMaharashtra Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Conduct of Bullock \nCart Race) Rules, 2017\u201d permitting Bullock Cart Race and on 11th \nOctober 2017, the High Court restrained conducting of Bullock \nCart Races within the State of Maharashtra.  The aforesaid Rules \nsought to regulate organisation of Bullock Cart Races.   \n7. A farmer from that State, Vikramsinh Nivrutti Bhosale from \nthe District of Sanghli, has instituted Special Leave Petition (Civil) \n7 \n \n3528 of 2018 assailing that order passed by the Bombay High \nCourt and in this reference, we shall deal with certain points raised \nin the said special leave petition as well.  \n8. A Division Bench of this Court by an order passed on 2 nd \nFebruary 2018 formulated five questions to be answered by a \nConstitution Bench and the papers were directed to be placed \nbefore the Hon\u2019ble Chief Justice of India.  The Division Bench had \nformulated the following 5 questions which we have to answer in \nthis judgment:- \ni. \u201cIs the Tamil Nadu Amendment Act referable, in pith \nand substance, to Entry 17, List III of the Seventh \nSchedule to the Constitution of India, or does it further \nand perpetuate cruelty to animals; and can it, \ntherefore, be said to be a measure of prevention of \ncruelty to animals? Is it colourable legislation which \ndoes not relate to any Entry in the State Li st or Entry \n17 of the Concurrent List? \n \nii.  The Tamil Nadu Amendment Act states that it is to \npreserve the cultural heritage of the State of Tamil \nNadu. Can the impugned Tamil Nadu Amendment Act \nbe stated to be part of the cultural heritage of the \npeople of the State of Tamil Nadu so as to receive the \nprotection of Article 29 of the Constitution of India? \n \n \niii.  Is the Tamil Nadu Amendment Act, in pith and \nsubstance, to ensure the survival and well -being of \nthe native breed of bulls? Is the Act, in pith and \nsubstance, relatable to Article 48 of the Cons titution \nof India? \n \niv.  Does the Tamil Nadu Amendment Act go contrary to \nArticles 51A(g) and 51A(h), and could it be said, \ntherefore, to be unreasonable and violative of Articles \n14 and 21 of the Constitution of India? \n \n \nv.  Is the impugned Tamil Nadu Amendment Act directly \ncontrary to the judgment in A. Nagaraja (supra), and \nthe review judgment dated 16th November, 2016 in \n8 \n \nthe aforesaid case, and whether the defects pointed \nout in the aforesaid two judgments could be said to \nhave been overcome by the Tamil Nadu Legislature by \nenacting the impugned Tamil Nadu Amendment Act?\u201d \n \n9. The Presidential assent was sought for by the three States in \nterms of Article 254(2) of the Constitution of India. On behalf of the \npetitioners, the very act of assent of the President has been \nquestioned and citing the judgment of this Court in the case of \nGram Panchayat of Village Jamalpur -vs- Malwinder Singh and \nOthers [(1985) 3 SCC 661] it has been argued that for obtaining \nsuch assent, complete details were not disclosed before the \nPresident. The judgment of this Court in Hoechst \nPharmaceuticals Ltd. and Others -vs- State of Bihar and Others \n[(1983) 4 SCC 45] was also cited by the petitioners to contend that \nsuch assent of the President is relevant only if t he legislation is \nrelatable to an Entry in List III of Seventh Schedule of the \nConstitution. But in our view, the Amendment Statutes are \nrelatable to Entry 17 of List III of Seventh Schedule and hence we \ndo not consider it necessary to deal with the ratio laid down in the \ncase of Hoechst Pharmaceuticals (supra). Certain other \njudgments were also cited in support of this proposition.  We shall \nexpress our opinion on this point in subsequent part of this \njudgment.  \n9 \n \n10. In W.P. (C) No.1152 of 2018, the legalit y of the Karnataka \nAmendment Act has been challenged. This petition was tagged with \nW.P.(C) No.1059 of 2017 by an order dated 7.12.2018. W.P.(C) \nNo.1059 of 2017 was heard along with T.C. (C) No.60 of 2021, a \nthree-Judge Bench of this Court took cognizance of the Karnataka \nand Maharashtra Amendment Acts and in an order passed by the \nsaid Bench on 16.12.2021, it was observed:-  \n\u201cThe entire matter in relation to similar amendments \nmade by the State of Tamil Nadu and State of \nKarnataka is now referred to the Constitution Bench, \nincluding to consider the question whether these \namendment Acts (of State of Tamil Nadu) overcome the \ndefects pointed out in the two judgments of this Court. \nSimilar question would arise in these writ petitions and \ntransferred case from  Maharashtra concerning the \nprovisions of State of Maharashtra. Hence, these writ \npetitions be heard along with writ petitions pertaining to \nthe State of Tamil Nadu and State of Karnataka.\u201d \n \n11. In the judgment of A. Nagaraja (supra), dealing with \nJallikattu and Bullock Cart Race in Maharashtra, the Division \nBench of this Court found bulls to be non -suitable for being \ninvolved in any sport s. The Bench found that the bulls were not \nperforming animals having no natural inclination for running like \na horse.  T he reasoning of the Bench in the case of A. Nagaraja \n(supra) would appear, inter-alia, from paragraphs 33, 37, 41, 44, \n53 and 73.  It has been held by the Court in these paragraphs:- \n\u201c33. The PCA Act is a welfare legislation which has to be \nconstrued bearing in mind the purpose and object of the Act \nand the directive principles of State policy. It is trite law that, \n10 \n \nin the matters of welfare legislation, the provisions of law \nshould be lib erally construed in favour of the weak and \ninfirm. The court also should be vigilant to see that benefits \nconferred by such remedial and welfare legislation are not \ndefeated by subtle devices. The court has got the duty that, \nin every case, where ingenuity is expanded to avoid welfare \nlegislations, to get behind the smokescreen and discover the \ntrue state of affairs. The court can go behind the form and \nsee the substance of the devise for which it has to pierce the \nveil and examine whether the guidelines or  the regulations \nare framed so as to achieve some other purpose than the \nwelfare of the animals. Regulations or guidelines, whether \nstatutory or otherwise, if they purport to dilute or defeat the \nwelfare legislation and the constitutional principles, the \ncourt should not hesitate to strike them down so as to \nachieve the ultimate object and purpose of the welfare \nlegislation. The court has also a duty under the doctrine of \nparens patriae to take care of the rights of animals, since \nthey are unable to take ca re of themselves as against \nhuman beings.\u201d \nXxx \n \n\u201c37. Section 11 generally deals with the cruelty to animals. \nSection 11 confers no right on the organisers to conduct \nJallikattu/bullock cart race. Section 11 is a beneficial \nprovision enacted for the welfare  and protection of the \nanimals and it is penal in nature. Being penal in nature, it \nconfers rights on the animals and obligations on all persons, \nincluding those who are in charge or care of the animals, \nAWBI, etc. to look after their well-being and welfare.\u201d \nxxx \n\u201c41. Section 11(3) carves out exceptions in five categories of \ncases mentioned in Sections 11(3)(a) to (e), which are as \nfollows: \n\u201c11. (3) Nothing in this section shall apply to\u2014 \n(a) the dehorning of cattle, or the castration or \nbranding or nose-roping of any animal, in the \nprescribed manner; or \n(b) the destruction of stray dogs in lethal \nchambers or by such other methods as may be \nprescribed; or \n(c) the extermination or destruction of any animal \nunder the authority of any law for the time be ing \nin force; or \n(d) any matter dealt with in Chapter IV; or \n11 \n \n(e) the commission or omission of any act in the \ncourse of the destruction or the preparation for \ndestruction of any animal as food for mankind \nunless such destruction or preparation was \naccompanied by the infliction of unnecessary pain \nor suffering.\u201d \nExceptions are incorporated based on \nthe \u201cdoctrine of necessity\u201d. Clause (b) to \nSection 11(3) deals with the destruction \nof stray dogs, out of necessity, \notherwise, it would be harmful to \nhuman being s. Clause (d) to Section \n11(3) deals with matters dealt with in \nChapter IV, incorporated out of \nnecessity, which deals with the \nexperimentation on animals, which is \nfor the purpose of advancement by new \ndiscovery of physiological knowledge or \nof knowledge which would be useful for \nsaving or for prolonging life or \nalleviating suffering or for combating \nany disease, whether of human beings, \nanimals or plants, which is not \nprohibited and is lawful. Clause (e) to \nSection 11(3) permits killing of animals \nas food for mankind, of course, without \ninflicting unnecessary pain or suffering, \nwhich clause is also incorporated \u201cout \nof necessity\u201d. Experimenting on animals \nand eating their flesh are stated to be \ntwo major forms of speciesism in our \nsociety. Over and above, the legislature, \nby virtue of Section 28, has favoured \nkilling of animals in a manner required \nby the religion of any community. \nEntertainment, exhibition or \namusement do not fall under these \nexempted categories and cannot be \nclaimed as a matter of right u nder the \ndoctrine of necessity.\u201d \nxxx \n\u201c44. Bulls, therefore, in our view, cannot be performing \nanimals, anatomically not designed for that, but are forced \nto perform, inflicting pain and suffering, in total violation of \nSection 3 and Section 11(1) of the PCA Act. Chapter V of the \nPCA Act deals with the performing animals. Section 22 of \nthe PCA Act places restriction on exhibition and training of \nperforming animals, which reads as under: \n12 \n \n\u201c22.Restriction on exhibition and training of \nperforming animals.\u2014No person shall exhibit or train\u2014 \n(i) any performing animal unless he is registered \nin accordance with the provisions of this Chapter; \n(ii) as a performing animal, any animal which the \nCentral Government may, by notification in the \nOfficial Gazette, specify as an animal which shall \nnot be exhibited or trained as a performing \nanimal.\u201d \nxxx \n\u201c53. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the TNRJ Act \nrefers to ancient culture and tradition and does not state \nthat it has any religious significance. Even the ancient \nculture and tradition do not support the conduct of Jallikattu \nor bullock cart race, in the form in which they are being \nconducted at present. Welfare and the well-being of the bull \nis Tamil culture and tradition, they do not approve of \ninfliction of any pain or suffering on the bulls, on the other \nhand, Tamil tradition and culture are to worship the bull \nand the bull is always considered as the vehicle of Lord \nShiva. Yeru Thazhuvu, in Tamil tradition, is to embrace bulls \nand not overpowering the bu ll, to show human bravery. \nJallikattu means, silver or gold coins tied to the bull's horns \nand in olden days those who got at the money to the bull's \nhorns would marry the daughter of the owner. Jallikattu or \nthe bullock cart race, as practised now, has never been the \ntradition or culture of Tamil Nadu.\u201d \nxxx \n\u201c73. Jallikattu and other forms of bulls race, as the various \nreports indicate, cause considerable pain, stress and strain \non the bulls. Bulls, in such events, not only do move their \nhead showing that they do not want to go to the arena but, \nas pain inflicted in the vadi vasal is so much, they have no \nother go but to flee to a situation which is adverse to them. \nBulls, in that situation, are stressed, exhausted, injured and \nhumiliated. Frustration of the  bulls is noticeable in their \nvocalisation and, looking at the facial expression of the \nbulls, ethologist or an ordinary man can easily sense their \nsuffering. Bulls, otherwise are very peaceful animals \ndedicating their life for human use and requirement, b ut \nthey are subjected to such an ordeal that not only inflicts \nserious suffering on them but also forces them to behave in \nways, namely, they do not behave, force them into the event \nwhich does not like and, in that process, they are being \ntortured to the hilt. Bulls cannot carry the so -called \nperformance without being exhausted, injured, tortured or \nhumiliated. Bulls are also intentionally subjected to fear, \n13 \n \ninjury\u2014both mentally and physically \u2014and put to \nunnecessary stress and strain for human pleasure and  \nenjoyment, that too, a species which has totally dedicated \nits life for human benefit, out of necessity.\u201d \n \n12. The 1960 Act has been enacted in pursuance of legislative \npower contained in Entry 17 of List III of the Seventh Schedule to \nthe Constitution of India.  The impact of the Amendment Acts on \nthe main Statute would be revealed from the comparative table \ngiven below:- \nProvisions The Prevention of \nCruelty to Animals \nAct, 1960 \n(\u201cPrincipal Act\u201d) \nThe Prevention of \nCruelty to Animals \n(Tamil Nadu \nAmendment) Act, \n2017 \nThe Prevention of \nCruelty to Animals \n(Karnataka Second \nAmendment) Act, \n2017 \nThe Prevention of \nCruelty to Animals \n(Maharashtra \nAmendment) Act, \n2017 \nScope  An Act to prevent the \ninfliction of \nunnecessary pain or \nsuffering on animals \nand for that purpose \nto amend the law \nrelating to the \nprevention of cruelty \nto animals. \nAn Act to amend the \nPrevention of Cruelty \nto Animals Act, 1960 \nso as to preserve the \ncultural heritage of \nthe State of Tamil \nNadu and to ensure \nthe survival and  \nwellbeing of the \nnative breeds of \nbulls. \n \nAn Act further to \namend the \nPrevention of Cruelty \nto Animals Act, 1960 \nin its application to \nthe State of \nKarnataka. \nAn Act to amend the \nPrevention of Cruelty \nto Animals Act, \n1960, in its \napplication to the \nState of \nMaharashtra. \nSection 2 Defintions.-In this \nAct, unless the \ncontext otherwise \nrequires,\u2015 (a) \n\u201canimal\u201d means any \nliving creature other \nthan a human being;

After the aforesaid three Amendment Acts received \nPresidential assent, the States of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra \nformulated Rules for conducting the aforesaid bovine sports.  The \nTamil Nadu Rules were titled \u201cThe Tamil Nadu Prevention of \nCruelty to Animals (Conduct of Jallikattu) Rules, 2017\u201d and for the \nState of Maharashtra, \u201cThe Maharashtra Prevention of Cruelty to \nAnimals (Co nduct of Bullock Cart Race) Rules, 2017 \u201d was \nformulated. So far as the State of Karnataka is concerned , a \nNotification was issued on similar lines by a Memorandum No. \nPSM 257 SLV -2014 dated 17 th December 2015 .   These \nRules/Notification seek to rigidly regulate conducting the aforesaid \nbovine sports.  They postulate provisions for application for \npermission of holding the sports, for participating in the race. For \norganising of Bullock Cart Race, Rules stipulate for the manner in \nwhich such races could be conducted with specifications for length \nof the track, rest period and isolation of the track from general \npublic.  The Tamil Nadu Rules specifically provides for examination \nof bulls, with specifications for  the arena, bull collection yard as \nalso setting  up of spectators\u2019 gallery.  These instruments in \nsubstance prohibit causing any physical disturbance to the bulls \nlike beating and poking them with sharp objects, sticks, pouring \n24 \n \nchilli powder in their eyes, twisting their tails amongst other such \npain inflicting acts. \n14. The main theme of the submissions of the petitioners/parties \nwho are assailing the Amendment Acts are founded on two planks.  \nMr. Shyam Divan, Mr. Anand Grover, Mr. Sidharth Luthra, Mr. \nKrishnan Venugopal and Mr. V. Giri, learned Senior Advocates \nhave appeared for the parties assailing continued performance of \nthese sports which are considered to be cruel.  The Respondents\u2019 \ncases supporting the continuation of  these sports have been \nmainly argued by Mr. Tushar Mehta, ld. Solicitor General , Mr. \nKapil Sibal, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi and Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned \nSenior Advocates. For the petitioners, their main case is that even \nafter the State Amendments, the activities sought to be legitimised \nstill remain destructive and contrary to the provisions of Sections \n3, 11(1) (a) and (m) of the 1960 Act.  It is their contention that the \nAmendment Acts do not cure the defects or deficiencies brought \nabout by the judgment of A. Nagaraja (supra).  The ratio of the said \njudgment is sought to be bypassed through these Amendment \nActs, which is impermissible in law.  It has also been argued that \nthe expression \u201cperson\u201d as used in Article 21 of the Constitution of \nIndia includes sentient anima ls and their liberty is sought to be \ncurtailed by legitimising the aforesaid bovine sports and the \n25 \n \ninstrument of such legitimisation being the three Amendment Acts \nis unreasonable and arbitrary, thereby not meeting the standard \nof Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In fact, that is the fourth \npoint of question of reference which we shall be addressing in this \njudgment. The petitioners seek to inter-weave Articles 14, 21, 48, \n51-A (h) and (g) to set up a right s-regime for the animals.  Their \ncontention is that the Fundamental Duty of Indian citizens to have \ncompassion for living creatures and to develop humanism result \nin corresponding rights for sentient animals to be protected for \ndistress and pain inflicting activities only having entertainment \nvalue for human beings.  \n15. The other argument advanced is that these sports cannot be \nheld to be part of cultural heritage of the State of Tamil Nadu which \nis so provided in the Preamble of the Amendment Act of that State. \nPreamble of the Tamil Nadu Amendment  Act provides that the \nobject of the said Statute is to preserve the cultural heritage of the \nState of Tamil Nadu and to ensure the survival and wellbeing of \nnative breeds of bulls. The said Act inserted [clause 2(d)] in the \ndefinition clause of the 1960 Act and amended Section 11(3) of the \nsame Statute, adding sub -clause (f) thereto. There are two more \nAmendments which would appear from the table we have given \nabove, but those are primarily to exempt Jallikattu from the \n26 \n \nrestrictive provisions of the 1960 A ct. In the judgment of A. \nNagaraja (supra) it was inter-alia held on the point of tradition and \nculture of Jallikattu:- \n\u201c54. The PCA Act, a welfare legislation, in our view, \novershadows or overrides the so -called tradition and \nculture. Jallikattu and bullock cart races, the manner in \nwhich they are conducted, have no support of Tamil \ntradition or culture. Assuming, it has been in vogue for quite \nsome time, in our view, the same should give way to the \nwelfare legislation, like the PCA Act which has been enacted \nto prevent infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering on \nanimals and confer duties and obligations on persons in \ncharge of animals. Of late, there are some attempts at \ncertain quarters, to reap maximum gains and the animals \nare being exploited by the human beings by using coercive \nmethods and inflicting unnecessary pain for pleasure, \namusement and enjoyment. We have a history of doing \naway with such evil practices in society, assuming such \npractices have the support of culture and tradition, as tr ied \nto be projected in the TNRJ Act. Professor Salmond states \nthat custom is the embodiment of those principles which \nhave commended themselves to the national conscience as \nthe principles of justice and public utility. This Court, in  N. \nAdithayan v. Travancore Devaswom Board  [(2002) 8 SCC \n106] (2002) 8 SCC 106, while examining the scope of \nArticles 25(1), 26(a), 26(b), 17, 14 and 21, held as follows: \n(SCC p. 125, para 18) \n\u201c18. \u2026 Any custom or usage irrespective of even \nany proof of their existence in pre-constitutional \ndays cannot be countenanced as a source of law \nto claim any rights when it is found to violate \nhuman rights, dignity, social equality and the \nspecific mandate of the Constitution and law \nmade by Parliament. No usage which is found to \nbe pernicious and considered to be in derogation \nof the law of the land or opposed to public policy \nor social decency can be accepted or upheld by \ncourts in the country.\u201d \n55. As early as 1500 -600 BC in Isha -Upanishads, it is \nprofessed as follows: \n\u201cThe universe along with its creatures belongs to \nthe land. No creature is superior to any other. \nHuman beings should not be above nature. Let no \none species encroach over the rights and \nprivileges of other species.\u201d \n27 \n \nIn our view, this is the culture and tradition of t he country, \nparticularly the States of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. \n \n56. The PCA Act has been enacted with an object to \nsafeguard the welfare of the animals and evidently to cure \nsome mischief and age old practices, so as to bring into \neffect some type of r eform, based on eco -centric principles, \nrecognising the intrinsic value and worth of animals. All the \nsame, the Act has taken care of the religious practices of the \ncommunity, while killing an animal vide Section 28 of the \nAct.\u201d \n \n16. On this basis, arguments have been advanced on behalf of \nthe petitioners that the Amendment Act of Tamil Nadu having \nregard to its Preamble seeks to invalidate conclusive judicial \nopinion without curing the defects specified in that decision in the \nconduct of Jallikattu. So far as the Karnataka Amendment Act is \nconcerned, in the definition clauses of \u201cBulls Race or Bullock Cart \nRace\u201d and \u201cKambala\u201d, they have been described as part of tradition \nand culture of the State. In the Maharashtra Act also the source of \nBullock Car t Race has been identified to be the tradition and \nculture of specified parts of that State in the definition clause of \nBullock Cart Race.  \n17. The argument of the petitioners and the interveners \nsupporting in substance the ban on performance of these sports \nhave been that the Statutes seek to validate the provisions that \nwere held to be illegal by this Court without curing the defects \noutlined in the judgment of A. Nagaraja  (supra).  In such \n28 \n \ncircumstances, the Amendment Acts could not be held to be in \nexercise of legitimate legislative power in the light of the \nconstitutional provisions and these enactments are colourable \nlegislations.

The judgment of the Maneka Gandhi (supra) \nwas also relied upon to contend that in order to protect \nFundamental Rights, the effect of the law has to be looked at and \nnot just theories and provisions of law.  \n18. Corollary s ubmissions of the petitioners are that after \nPresidential assent was given to the three Statutes, they \nlegitimised the three aforesaid events but the manner in which \nthey are conducted is contrary to the provisions of Sections 3, \n11(1)(a) and (m)  as wa s held in the A. Nagaraja  (supra) case. \nHence, the attempt of the Amendment Acts is to override a judicial \nverdict without addressing the grounds on which this Court had \nfound Jallikattu and Bullock Cart Race in the States of Tamil Nadu \nand Maharashtra res pectively to be in violation of the 1960 Act. \nThis legislative exercise, as argued by the petitioners, go contrary \nto Constitutional scheme. The authorities cited on this point are  \nState of T amil Nadu  -vs- State of Kerala  (supra), Chief \nSecretary to the Government, Chennai, Tamil Nadu and \nOthers -vs- Animal Welfare Board and Another  [(2017) 2 SCC \n30 \n \n144] and Rupa Ashok Hurra -vs- Ashok Hurra  and Another  \n[(2002) 4 SCC 388]. \n19. In the case of A. Nagaraja (supra), the two Judge Bench, on \nthe basis of affidavit of the Animal Welfare Board of India and \nMoEF&CC described the manner in which Jallikattu was being \nperformed.  The preparation of the bulls for these sports entail, but \nnot limited to, ear cutting/mutilation, twisting of tail, resulting in \nfracture and dislocation of tail bones. It was also stated that 95% \nof the bulls that were used in the process of participation in these \nsports were soiled with faeces from below the base of their tails \nand across the large part of their hindquarters. Additionally, \nbovine species were forced to stand together in accumulated waste \nfor hours. At one of the locations of the events, the Animal Welfare \nBoard found that in the \u201ccollection area\u201d, a bull died due to injuries \ncaused as a result of head -on collision with a moving passenger \nbus.  Injuries were caused to muscle bones, nerves and blood \nvessels also as the bulls were subjected to tail-biting, poking them \nwith sharp objects to excite them, use of irritants in the e yes and \nnose. Vadi vassal (the cattle bull entry place in Jallikattu) were \nnarrow entry corridors which had cramping conditions and bulls \nwere made to move sideways which is an unnatural movement for \nthem. There was also lack of food and water at the respe ctive \n31 \n \nlocations and instances of spectators beating, biting and agitating \nthe bulls.  Such abhorrent practises surfaced from investigation \nreports relied on by the petitioners.  In paragraph 67 of A. Nagaraja \n(supra), as reported in the aforesaid journal, substantial emphasis \nhas been laid on Article 48 of the Constitution of India read with \nFundamental Duties enshrined in Article 51-A (g) and (h). On that \nbasis, argument was advanced that sentient species should be \naccorded the protective umbrella of Article 21 of the Constitution.  \nWe shall deal with that aspect later in this judgment.  In fact, \nargument in this line has been advanced on the basis that sentient \nanimals have natural rights to live a life with dignity without any \ninfliction of cruelty.  The other line of submission on behalf of the \npetitioners is that the subject dealt with by the three Amendment \nActs does not relate to List III.  On this count the authorities cited \nwere State of Bihar  and Others  -vs- Indian Aluminium \nCompany and Others [(1997) 8 SCC 360 ], Hoechst \nPharmaceuticals Ltd.  (supra), M. Karunanidhi -vs- Union of \nIndia and Another  [(1979) 3 SCC 431 ] and K.T. Plantation  \nPrivate Ltd. and Another  -vs- State of Karnataka  [(2011) 9              \nSCC 1].  \n20. It has also been the argument of the petitioners that making \nexception for bulls to carve them out of the protective mechanism \n32 \n \nof the 1960 Act was not based on any intelligible criteria but on an \narbitrary selection.  Learned Counsel for the petitioners re lied on \nDirector of Education (Secondary)  and Another  -vs- \nPushpendra Kumar and Others [(1998) 5 SCC 192], Harbilas Rai \nBansal -vs-  State of Punjab and Another [(1996)  1 SCC 1], State \nof Gujarat and Another -vs- Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soni  and \nOthers [(1983) 2 SCC 33] and Shayara Bano -vs- Union of India \nand Others [(2017) 9 SCC 1] to substantiate this argument. \n21. We shall first deal with the argument advanced on behalf of \nthe petitioners that animals have rights. In fact, what has been \nurged before us is that animals have Fundamental Rights as also \nlegal rights. It has been held in A. Nagaraja  (supra) case at \nparagraph 66 (in the Report):- \n\u201c66.  Rights guaranteed to the animals under Sections 3, 11, \netc. are only statutory rights. The same have to be elevated \nto the status of fundamental rights, as has been done by \nfew countries around the world, so as to secure their honour \nand dignity. Rights and freedoms guaranteed to the \nanimals under Sections 3 and 11 have to be read along with \nArticle 51 -A(g) and (h) of the Constitution, which is the \nmagna carta of animal rights.\u201d \n \n22. The concept of animal rights has been anchored by the \npetitioners on dual foundation. It has been submitted that our \njurisprudence does not recognise rights only for human beings and \nNarayan Dutt Bhatt -vs- Union of India [(2018) SCC OnLine Utt \n645] has been cited to demonstrate that animals are legal entities \n33 \n \nhaving a distinct persona with corresponding rights, duties and \nliabilities as that of a legal person.  In or der to put emphasis on \nthis concept of evolving rights, petitioners have submitted that our \nlegal system is both organic and dynamic in nature and with \npassage of time law must change.  (Saurabh Chaudri and Others             \n-vs- Union of India  and Others  [(2003) 11 SCC 146 ], Chief \nJustice of Andhra Pradesh and Others -vs- L.V.A. Dixitulu and \nOthers [(1979) 2 SCC 34 ], Video Electronics Pvt. Ltd.  and \nAnother -vs- State of Punjab and Another [(1990) 3 SCC 87] and \nAshok Kumar Gupta and Another v. State of U.P. and Others , \n[(1997) 5 SCC 201 ]). In this regard, certain international \nauthorities being Argentina, Case No.P -72.254/2015 has been \ncited. Further, our attention has been drawn to the Animal \nWellbeing (Sentience) Act, 2022  recognising animals as sentient \nbeings in the United Kingdom. It has also been asserted that rights \nof sentient animals have been recognised by the Constitutional \nCourt of Ecuador. On behalf of the respondents, the factum of \nexistence of animal rights has not been directly contested but the \nstand of the respondents on this point is that the rights which the \nsentient animal would have enjoyed ought to be subject to the \nlegislative provisions and in a case of this nature, which is likely \nto have seminal impa ct not only on our jurisprudence but our \n34 \n \nsociety as well, legislature would be a better judge to determine \nwhat would be the nature, contours and limitations of such rights. \nThe effect of this argument is that the rights of sentient animals \ncan be recognised by law but such rights would be in a nature as \ndetermined by the appropriate law -making body and not by \njudicial interpretation.  \n23. On the point of recognizing rights of animals, the legislative \napproach appears to us to be two -fold. Of course, the an imals \ncannot demand their right in the same way human beings can \nassert for bringing a legislat ion, but as part of the social and \ncultural policy the law makers have recognised the rights of \nanimals by essentially imposing restriction on human beings on \nthe manner in which they deal with animals. By virtue of Article \n48 of the Constitution of India whi ch essentially operates as a \nnational guideline for law makers, a two -way path has been \ndevised. The first is imposing duty on the State to organise \nagriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines. \nThe second is emphasising the duty of the State to take steps for \npreserving and improving the breeds and prohibiting slaughter of \ncows and calves and other milch and draught cattle. Under the \nchapter on  Fundamental Duties, a citizen is required to protect \nand improve the natural environment incl uding forests, lakes, \n35 \n \nrivers and wildlife ought to have compassion for living creatures. \nThe petitioners want us to interpret the Amendment Acts in light \nof these two constitutional provisions and want us to scrutinise \nthe three Statutes taking into cognizance pain and suffering that \nwould be caused to them, so that the bovine species are not \ncompelled to participate in the aforesaid sports organised by \nhuman beings for the latter\u2019s own pleasure. It is the petitioners\u2019 \nstand that wherever the 1960 Act enjoi ns human beings from \nperforming certain acts vis-\u00e0-vis animals, the obligations ought to \nbe translated jurisprudentially into rights of the animals not to be \nsubjected to such prohibited acts. The line of reasoning in this \nregard on behalf the petitioners is that the very manner in which \nthese sports activities are undertaken directly offend the aforesaid \ntwo provisions of the 1960 Act. Merely by introducing these three \nAmendment Acts, the organisers of these events cannot be saved \nfrom the offences specified in the 1960 Act, which aspect has been \ndealt with in detail in the judgment of this Court in the case of A. \nNagaraja (supra). \n24. On the question of conferring fundamental right on animals \nwe do not have any precedent. The Division Bench in the case of \nA. Nagaraja  (supra) also does not lay down that animals have \nFundamental Rights. The only tool available for testing this \n36 \n \nproposition is interpreting the three Amendment Acts on the anvil \nof reasonableness in Article 14 of the Constitution of India. While \nthe protection under Article 21 has been conferred on person as \nopposed to a citizen, which is the case in Article 19 of the \nConstitution, we do not think it will be prudent for us to venture \ninto a judicial adventurism to bring bulls within the said protected \nmechanism. We have our doubt as to whether detaining a stray \nbull from the street against its wish could give rise to the \nconstitutional writ of habeas corpus or not. In the judgment of A. \nNagaraja (supra), the question of elevation of the statu tory rights \nof animals to the realm of fundamental rights has been left at the \nadvisory level or has been framed as a judicial suggestion. We do \nnot want to venture beyond that and leave this exercise to be \nconsidered by the appropriate legislative body. W e do not think \nArticle 14 of the Constitution can also be invoked by any animal \nas a person. While we can test the provisions of an animal welfare \nlegislation, that would be at the instance of a human being or a \njuridical person who may espouse the cause of animal welfare.  \n25. We shall next test the argument of the authorities, i.e., the \nUnion, the three States as also the Animal Welfare Board (in their \nchanged stance) that bovine sports are part of the culture and \ntradition of the respective States. We ha ve already referred to the \n37 \n \nrelevant provisions of the three Amendment Acts which carries \nexpression to this effect. \n26. Ordinarily, whether a particular practice or event is part of \nculture or tradition is to be decided by the custom and usage of a \nparticular community or a geographical region which can be \ntranslated into an enactment by the appropriate legislature. But \nhere the continuance of the subject sports have been found to be \nin breach of a Central Statute by a Division Bench of this Court \nand these three Amendment Acts seek to revive the earlier position. \nThat is the petitioners\u2019 argument.  \n27. In order to come to a definitive conclusion on this question, \nsome kind of trial on evidence would have been necessary. It is also \nnot Court\u2019s jurisdiction to decide if a particular event or activity or \nritual forms culture or tradition of a community or region. But if a \nlong lasting tradition goes against the law, the law Courts obviously \nwould have to enforce the law. Learned counsel appearing for the \nparties, however, have cited different ancient texts and modern \nliterature to justify their respective stand s. In Public Interest \nLitigations, this Court has developed the practice of arriving at a \nconclusion on subjects of this nature without insi sting on proper \ntrial to appreciate certain social or economic conditions going by \navailable reliable literature. In paragraphs 53 and 73 in the case of  \n38 \n \nA. Nagaraja (supra), there is judicial determination about the \npractice being offensive to the provisions of the Central Statute. It \nwould be trite to repeat that provisions of a Statute cannot be \noverridden by a traditional or cultural event. Thus, we accept the \nargument of the petitioners that at the relevant point of time when \nthe decision in the case o f A. Nagaraja (supra) was delivered, the \nmanner in which Jallikattu was performed did breach the aforesaid \nprovisions of the 1960 Act and hence conducting such sports was \nimpermissible.  \n28. But that position of law has changed now and the \nAmendment Acts h ave introduced a new regime  for conducting \nthese events. It is a fact that the Amendment Acts per se seeks to \nlegitimize the aforesaid three bovine sports by including them by \ntheir respective names and the body of the Statute themselves do \nnot refer to any procedure by which these sports shall be held . If \nthat was the position these Amendment Acts would have fallen foul \nof the ratio of the decisions of this Court in the case s of S.S. Bola \nand Others (supra), State of Tamil Nad u -vs- State of Kerala  \n(supra), Madan Mohan Pathak  (supra), National Agricultural \nCooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (supra), In Re \nPunjab Agreement Act  (supra), Mafatlal (supra), S.T. S adiq \n(supra) and A.R. Antulay (supra). The stand of the respondents \n39 \n \nhowever is that many of the offending elements of Jallikattu, \nKambala or Bullock Cart Race have been eliminated by the Rules \nmade under the Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra Amendment Act s \nand the State of Karnataka has issued statutory notification laying \ndown rigid regulatory measures for conducting these sports. These \nRules specify isolated arena for the sports  or events  to be \nconducted including setting up of both bull run and bull collection \narea, galleries separating spectators from directly coming into \ncontact with bulls. The learned counsel for the respondents want \nus to read the Statutes and the Rules together to counter the \nargument of the petitioners that the Amendment Acts  merely \nreintroduce the offend ing sports into the main Statute for their \nrespective States without correcting or removing the defects \npointed out by this Court in the case of A. Nagaraja (supra). In the \ncase of State of U.P. and Others -vs-  Babu Ram Upadhya  [(1961) \n2 SCR 679] , it was inter alia observed that the fundamental \nprinciple of construction was that  the Rules made under the \nStatute must be treated as a part and parcel thereof as if they were \ncontained in the parent A ct. In the case of Peerless General \nFinance and Inves tment Co. Ltd.  and Another -vs- Reserve \nBank of India [(1992) 2 SCC 343], it was held:- \n\u201c52. In State of U.P.  v. Babu Ram Upadhya  [(1961) 2 SCR \n679 : AIR 1961 SC 751 : (1961) 1 Cri LJ 773] this Court held \n40 \n \nthat rules made under a statute must be treated, for all \npurposes of construction or obligations, exactly as if they \nwere in that Act and a re to the same effect as if they were \ncontained in the Act and are to be judicially noticed for all \npurposes of construction or obligations. The statutory rules \ncannot be described or equated with administrative \ndirections. In  D.K.V. Prasada Rao  v. Government of \nA.P. [AIR 1984 AP 75 : (1983) 2 Andh WR 344] the same \nview was laid down. Therefore, the directions are \nincorporated and become part of the Act itself. They must be \ngoverned by the same principles as the statute itself. The \nstatutory presumption tha t the legislature inserted every \npart thereof for a purpose and the legislative intention \nshould be given effect to, would be applicable to the \nimpugned directions.\u201d \n \n29. The Tamil Nadu Amendment Act contains stipulation to the \neffect that conduct of Jallikattu subject to such Rules and \nregulations as may be framed by the State Government shall be \npermitted. Section 38 -B of the Maharashtra Act provides Rule \nmaking power of the State consistent with the Rules made by the \nCentral Government.  Both these Statutes have become part of the \n1960 Act in their respective States and specifically confer Rule \nmaking power to the States and Rules have been framed. In such \ncircumstances, as held by this Court in the case of Peerless \nGeneral Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. (supra), our opinion is \nthat these Rules have to be read along  with the Amendment Acts \nfor their proper interpretation. So far as the Karnataka Amendment \nAct is concerned, two fresh restrictions have been imposed in \nconducting Kambala by virtue of introduction of Section 3(2) in the \nmain Act after Amendment. These conditions ban  unnecessary \n41 \n \npain or suffering that would be caused to the animals by the person \nin charge of the animals conducting Kambala and  make such \npractice subject to the conditions as may be specified by the State \nGovernment by notification. Following the same analogy which we \nhave expressed earlier while reading the Amendment Acts of Tamil \nNadu and Maharashtra, in our opinion the Notification issued by \nthe State of Karnataka ought to be accorded same status as Rule \nand has also to be read as integral part of the Statute, as amended. \nThese Rules and the Notification ought not to be segregated from \nthe Amendment Acts for appreciating their true scope while \nexamining the petitioners\u2019 claim that the Amendment Acts, \nanalysed in isolation from the said Rules and the Notification would \nbe contrary to the findings of this Court in the case of A. Nagaraja \n(supra). \n30. In our opinion, the expressions Jallikattu, Kambala and Bull \nCart Race as introduced by the Amendment Acts of the three States \nhave undergone substantial change in the manner they were used \nto be practiced  or performed  and the factual condition s that \nprevailed at the time the A. Nagaraja  (supra) judgment was \ndelivered cannot be equated with the present situation.  We cannot \ncome to the conclusion that in th e changed circumstances, \nabsolutely no pain or suffering would be inflicted upon the bulls \n42 \n \nwhile holding these sports. But we are satisfied that the large part \nof pain inflicting practices, as they prevailed in the manner these \nthree sports were performed  in the pre -amendment period have \nbeen substantially diluted by the introduction of these statutory \ninstruments. Argument was advanced that in reality these welfare \nmeasures may not be practiced and the system as it prevailed could \ncontinue. We, however, cannot proceed in exercise of our judicial \npower on the assumption that a law ought to be struck down on \napprehension of its abuse  or disobedience . All the three bovine \nsports, after Amendment, assume different character in their \nperformance and practice and for these reasons we do not accept \nthe petitioners\u2019 argument that the Amendment Acts were merely a \npiece of  colourable legislation with cosmetic change to override \njudicial pronouncement. Once we read the amended Statutes with \nthe respective Rules or Notification, we do not find them to \nencroach upon the Central legislation. Respondents have cited a \nlarge body of authorities to defend their stand that these are not \ncases of colourable legislation but we do not consider it necessary \nto refer to all these judgments individually as we have come to this \nconclusion after analysing various statutory instruments covering \nthe field. \n43 \n \n31. Can the Amendment Acts be struck down for being arbitrary? \nThere is a body of cases in which legislations have been invalidated \non this ground.  So far as the subject of the present controversy is \nconcerned, the bulls form a distinct species referred to as draught \nor pack animals as opposed to horses, which are adapted to run. \nBut we decline to hold that just because bulls lack the natural \nability to run like a horse, the subject-sports which are seasonally \nheld shall be held to be contrary to the provisions of the 1960 Act. \nIn fact, on behalf of the respondents it was argued that these genre \nof bulls are specially bred and have natural ability to run. There \nare contrary views on this point. But in our opinion, no irrational \nclassification as regards these bull sports have been made by the \nlegislature so as to attract the  mischief which Article 14 of the \nConstitution of India seeks to prevent. The validity of a legislative \nAct can also be negated on the ground of it being unreasonable . \nThe element of unreasonableness here is that the bovine s pecies \ninvolved herein are bein g subject ed to unnecessary pain and \nsuffering mainly for entertainment purpose. But the 1960 Act itself \ncategorizes several activities which cause pain and suffering, even \nto a sentient animal. The judgment in the case of A. Nagaraja  \n(supra) was largely founded on factual basis that bulls were \nsentient animals, and the sports involved were unnecessary, as \n44 \n \nopposed to being necessary for human survival. But the 1960 Act, \non which the petitioners\u2019 case largely rests, proceeds on the basis \nof perceived human necessity to employ animals in certain load \ncarrying and entertainment activities. For instance, while other \nmeans of carriage of goods are available, why should bulls be \npermitted to undertake such activities - which are apparently \ninvoluntary and subject these sentient bovine species to pain and \nsuffering? Horse racing is allowed under Performing Animals \n(Registration) Rules, 2001. Horse is also a sentient animal. But the \nfact remains that by making them perform in races, some element \nof pain and suffering must be caused to horses. Here, the focus \nshifts from causing pain and suffering to the degree of pain and \nsuffering to which a sentient animal is subjected to while being \ncompelled to undertake certain activities for the benefit of human \nbeings. Similarly, proponents of vegetarianism may argue that \nslaughtering animals is not necessary as human beings can \nsurvive without animal protein. In our opinion, we should not take \nup this balancing exercise which has societal impact in discharge \nof our judicial duties. This kind of exercise ought to be left for the \nlegislature to decide upon.  \n32. We shall now turn to the petitioners\u2019 case assailing the legality \nof the State Amendments  by invoking the \u201cDoctrine of Pith and \n45 \n \nSubstance\u201d.  On that count, their submission is based on two \nprinciples. First, it has been urged that even after the Amendment, \nthe performance of these sports continue to inflict pain and injury \non the participating bulls and secondly, it was found by this Court \nin A. Nagaraja (supra), that these sports are  in violation of the \naforesaid provisions of the 1960 Act at the time  when the three \nState Amendments were not enacted .  On the face of it, learned \ncounsel appearing for the petitioners argued, that the Amendment \nActs does not in any way provide remedial measures which could \nhave rendered the three sports cured of the legal failing  as is \npostulated in the said provisions . According to the petitioners,  \nthese Acts seek to only introduce the Jallikattu, Kambala and \nBullock Cart Race as permissible activities within the provisions of \nthe 1960 Act . Even if certain sports by their name s are included \nwithin the ambit of permissible activity, the provisions of Sections \n3, 11(1) (a) an d (m) of the 1960 Act are not rendered otiose.  The \nother point raised by the petitioners is that the subject of Jallikattu \ndoes not come within the ambit of Entry 17 of List III of the Seventh \nSchedule to the Constitution of India and hence the State  \nAssemblies lacked  the legislative competence to enact the \nAmendment Acts . Presidential assent would not cure the said \nincompetency, it is urged by the petitioners. We have found no flaw \n46 \n \nin the process of obtaining Presidential assent having regard to the \nprovisions of Article 254(2) of the Constitution of India.  \n33.  The \u201cDoctrine of Pith and Substance \u201d has been explained in \nthe well-known text, \u201cPrinciples of Statutory Interpretation\u201d by G.P. \nSingh. We quote below the extract from 14th Edition of that text:- \n\u201cThe question whether the Legislature has kept itself within the \njurisdiction assigned to it or has encroached upon a forbidden \nfiled is determined by finding out the true nature and character \nor pith and substance of the legislation which may be different \nfrom its consequential effects.  If the pith and substance of the \nlegislation is covered by an entry within the permitted \njurisdiction of the Legislature any incidental encroachment in the \nrival f ield is to disregarded.  There is a presumption of \nconstitutionality of statutes and hence, prior to determining \nwhether there is any repugnancy between a Central Act and a \nState Act, it has to determined whether both Acts relate to the \nsame entry in List III, and whether there is a \u2018direct\u2019 and \n\u2018irreconcilable\u2019 conflict between the two, applying the doctrine of \n\u2018pith and substance\u2019. \n \nThe petitioners have relied on a several authorities explaining \nthis doctrine. These are State of Rajasthan -vs- Shri G. Chawla \nand Dr Pohumal  [(1959) Supp (1) SCR 904], Ishwari Khetan \nSugar Mills (P) Ltd.  and Others -vs- State of U.P.  and Others \n[(1980) 4 SCC 136],  Federation of Hotel & Restaurant \nAssociation of India, etc. -vs- Union of India and Others [(1989) \n3 SCC 634], State of A.P. and Others -vs- McDowell & Co. and \nOthers [(1996) 3 SCC 709], State of W.B. -vs- Kesoram Industries \nLtd. and Others  [(2004) 10 SCC 201] and Hoechst \nPharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra).  \n47 \n \n34. First we shall examine as to whether conducting these bovine \nsports is relatable to Item 17 of the concurrent list. It stipulates:- \n\u201cPrevention of Cruelty to Animals.\u201d \nIn the case of I.N Saksena -vs- State of Madhya Pradesh [(1976) \n4 SCC 750] , this Court had laid down that legislative lists in the \nConstitution ought to be interpreted in a wide amplitude. The 1960 \nAct in whole and the subjects of the three Amendments directly \ndeal with the question of prevention of cruelty to animals.  There is \nno other entry in any of the lists to which this subject could be \nconnected with.  In such circumstances , we reject the contention \nof the petitioners that the State Legislatures inherently lacked \njurisdiction to bring th ese Amendments, which subsequently \nreceived Presidential assent. On behalf of the respondents, several \ndecisions have been  relied upon in support of this argument. \nHaving regard to the view  that we have already taken, we do not \nconsider it necessary to reproduce all these decisions.   \n35. Next comes the question as to whether even after the said \nAmendments, Jallikattu and the other two activities could be held \nto be beyond legislative competence of the three legislative bodies. \nWe have already held that the three Amendment Acts have to be \nread together with the consequential Rules or Notifications.  In our \nview, these Rules, once treated as part of the Acts, alter the manner \n48 \n \nof conducting these sports and once th ese provisions are \nimplemented, the mischief sought to be remedied by the aforesaid \ntwo provisions of 1960 Act (i.e. Sections 3 and 11(1)(a) and (m) ) \nwould not be attracted anymore.  Thus, the argument that the \nAmendment Acts are void because they seek to override the \njudgment of A. Nagaraja (supra) cannot be sustained as the basis \nof that judgment having regard to the nature and manner in which \nthe offending activities were carried on has been altered.   \n36. Petitioners contend t hat even after changed procedure \ncontemplated by the three statutory instruments, the very \nparticipation of the bulls in these sports involve  a strong element \nof involuntariness as well as some element of pain and suffering.  \nIn the case s of T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad -vs- Union of \nIndia and Others [(2012) 4 SCC 362], Centre for Environmental \nLaw, World Wide Fund -India -vs- Union of India and Others \n[(2013) 8 SCC 234] and N.R. Nair and Others -vs- Union of India \nand Others [(2001) 6 SCC 84] , it has been broadly held that \nanimals have inherent right in natural law to live a dignified life \nwithout infliction of cruelty and this principle is sought to extended \nto proscribe Jallikattu, Kambala and Bullock Cart Race. In the case \nof N.R. Nair (supra), it was held that animals have capability  to \nbear pain and suffering and that they have a fear from restrictions \n49 \n \non their spaces and bodies and other forms of physical discomfort. \nBut we need not refer to these authorities as we accept the \nobligation of human being s to ensure th at animals do not suffer \nfrom pain and injury.  Our jurisdiction , however, does not extend \nto provide an absolute protection to the animals from any manner \nof infliction of pain and suffering.  What the broad theme of 1960 \nAct is that the animals must be protected from unnecessary pain \nand suffering. This aspect has been dealt with in the case of A. \nNagaraja (supra). This approach would  be apparent from a plain \nreading of Section 11 of the 1960 Act itself even before the three \nAmendments where the legislature appears to have undertaken a \nbalancing exercise without disturbing the concept of ownership of \nanimal by an individual and such individual\u2019s right to employ these \nanimals in the aforesaid sports .  We have already expressed our \nviews on the point earlier in this judgment. \n37. As we proceed on the basis that the Constitution does not \nrecognise any Fundamental Right for animals, we shall have to test \nthe legality of the three Statutes against the provisions of 1960 Act \nalong with the constitutional provisions of Articles 48, 51-A (g) and \n(h). The three Statutes will also have to meet the test of \narbitrariness, wh ich has become the foundation of our \nconstitutional jurisprudence after this Court delivered the \n50 \n \njudgment in the cases of E.P. Royappa -vs- State of Tamil Nadu \nand Another  [(1974) 4 SCC 3], Ajay Hasia and Others -vs- Khalid \nMujib Sehravardi and Others [(1981) 1 SCC 722] and Joseph \nShine -vs- Union of India [(2018) 2 SCC 189]. \n38.  Factual arguments have been advanced that prohibition on \nthe practice of particularly Bullock Cart Race could result in  \nultimate collapse of a particular genre of cattle which a re useful \nfor agricultural purpose and hence the aforesaid Amendment Acts \nto be treated to be relatable to  Entry 15 of List II of the Seventh \nSchedule to the Con stitution of India.  But having regard to the \nnature of challenge, we are of the view that in pith and substance, \nthe Amendment Acts seek to address the question of prevention of \ncruelty to animals.  The tenor of the Maharashtra Amendment Act \nand its Preamble point to that interpretation and the object of the \nAmendments primarily is relatable to Item 17 of the Concurrent \nList. Hence, we reject the argument that the Maharashtra \nAmendment Act has been legislated for the preservation, \nprotection and improvement of stock and pr evention of animal \ndiseases, veterinary training and practice.  So far as the argument \nthat livelihood of farmers and people associated with Bullock Cart \nRace could be adversely affected if the prohibition which the            \nwrit petitioners want us to impose by striking down the aforesaid  \n51 \n \n \nAmendment Statute is concerned, we do not need to address this \nargument. We have, in this judgment dealt with the question as to \nwhether provisions of 1960 Act are being violated or not, as was \nheld in the case of A. Nagaraja (supra), decided prior to the three \nAmendment Statutes. The effect of the said prohibition upon the \nlivelihood of the people of that State is said to be espoused in I.A. \nNo.170346 of 2022. If we were to hold that these bovine sports \noffended the provisions of the 1960 Act, the deprivation \napprehended would have come  within the reasonable restriction \nclause enshrined in Article 19 (6) of the Constitution of India. In \nsuch a situation, a law made in that regard would also be protected \nin relation to the challenge on the basis of Article 21 of the \nConstitution of India being procedure established by law. \n39. In the judgment of A. Nagaraja (supra), the Division Bench of \nthis Court , while examining the claim of the petitioners therein  \nheld that Jallikattu is dangerous not only to bulls but also to \nhuman and many participants and spectators sustained injury in \ncourse of such events.  So far as human beings are concerned, their \ninjuries would attract the principle of Tort known in common law \nas \u201cvoluntary non fit injuria\u201d.  \n52 \n \n40. In the light of what we have already discussed, we answer the \nfive questions referred to us in the following terms:- \n(i) The Tamil Nadu Amendment Act is not a piece of colourable \nlegislation.  It relates, in pith and substance, to Entry 17 of List \nIII of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.  It \nminimises cruelty to animals in the concerned sports and once \nthe Amendment Act, along with their Rules and Notification \nare implemented, the aforesaid sports would not come within \nthe mischief sought to be remedied by Sections 3, 11(1) (a) and \n(m) of the 1960 Act. \n(ii)  Jallikattu is a type of bovine sports and we are satisfied on \nthe basis of materials disclosed before us, that it is going on in \nthe State of Tamil Nadu for at least last few centuries. This \nevent essentially involves a bull which is set free in an arena \nand human participants are meant to grab the hump to score \nin the \u201cgame\u201d. But whether this has become integral part of \nTamil culture or not requires religious, cultural  and social \nanalysis in greater detail, which in our opinion, is an exercise \nthat cannot be undertaken by the Judiciary.  The question as \nto whether the Tamil Nadu Amendment Act is to preserve the \ncultural heritage of a particular State is a debateable issue \nwhich has to be concluded in the House of the People. This \n53 \n \nought not be a part of judicial inquiry and particularly having \nregard to the activity in question and the materials in the form \nof texts cited before us by both the petitione rs and the \nrespondents, this question cannot be conclusively determined \nin the writ proceedings. Since legislative exercise has already \nbeen undertaken and Jallikattu has been found to be part of \ncultural heritage of Tamil Nadu, we would not disrupt this view \nof the legislature. We do not accept the view reflected in the \ncase of A. Nagaraja that performance of Jallikattu is not a part \nof the cultural heritage of the people of the State of Tamil Nadu. \nWe do not think there was sufficient material before the Court \nfor coming to this conclusion. In the Preamble to the \nAmendment Act, Jallikattu has been described to be part of \nculture and tradition of Tamil Nadu. In the case of A. Nagaraja \n(supra), the Division Bench found the cultural approach \nunsubstantiated and referring to the manner in which the \nbulls are inflicted pain and suffering, the Division Bench \nconcluded that such activities offended Sections 3 and 11(1)(a) \nand (m) of the 1960 Act. Even if we proceed on the basis that \nlegislature is best suited branch of the State to determine if \nparticular animal -sports are part of cultural tradition of a \nregion or community, or not, if such cultural event or tradition \n54 \n \noffends the law, the  penal consequence would follow. Such \nactivities cannot be justified on the ground of being part of \ncultural tradition of a State.  In A. Nagaraja (supra), the sports \nwere held to attract the restriction of Sections 3 and 11(1)(a) \nand (m) of the 1960 Act because of the manner it was practiced. \nThe Amendment Act read with the Rules seek to substantially \nminimise the pain and suffering and continue with the \ntraditional sports. The Amendment having received \nPresidential assent, we do not think there is any  flaw in the \nState action. \u201cJallikattu\u201d as bovine sports have to be isolated \nfrom the manner in which they were earlier practiced and \norganising the sports itself would be permissible, in terms of \nthe Tamil Nadu Rules. \n(iii) The Tamil Nadu Amendment Act is  not in pith and \nsubstance, to ensure survival and well -being of the native \nbreeds of bulls. The said Act is also not relatable to Article 48 \nof the Constitution of India. Incidental impact of the said \nAmendment Act may fall upon the breed of a particular type of \nbulls and affect agricultural activities, but in pith and \nsubstance the Act is relatable to Entry 17 of List III of the \nSeventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.  \n55 \n \n(iv) Our answer to this question is in the negative. In our \nopinion, the Tamil Nadu Amendment Act does not go contrary \nto the Articles 51-A (g) and 51-A(h) and it does not violate the \nprovisions of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. \n(v) The Tamil Nadu Amendment Act read along with the Rules \nframed in that behalf is not directly contrary to the ratio of the \njudgment in the case of A. Nagaraja (supra) and judgment of \nthis Court delivered on 16 th November 2016 dismissing the \nplea for Review of the A. Nagaraja (supra) judgment as we are \nof the opinion that the defects pointed out in the aforesaid two \njudgments have been overcome by the State Amendment Act \nread with the Rules made in that behalf.  \n41.  Our decision on the Tamil Nadu Amendment Act would also \nguide the Maharashtra and the Karnataka Amendment Acts and we \nfind all the three Amendment Acts to be valid legislations. \n42. However, we direct that the law contained in the \nAct/Rules/Notification shall be strictly enforced by the authorities. \nIn particular, we direct that the District Magistrates/competent \nauthorities shall be responsible for ensuring strict compliance of the \nlaw, as amended along with its Rules/Notifications. \n56 \n \n43. All the I.As. for Intervention are allowed in the above terms. As \nwe have answered the referred questions, we do not think any \npurpose would be served in keeping the writ petitions pending. All \nthe writ petitions shall stand dismissed. The appeal and the \nTransferred Case shall also stand disposed of in the above terms.  \n44. Other pending applications, if any, are also disposed of.  \n45. There shall be no order as to costs. \n \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . J. \n(K.M.
